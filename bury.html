                    <p>Alice and Rachel were the perfect horror movie couple. The audience held its breath at their slow-burn devotion—the stolen glances, the fragile touches, the way horror curled itself around them yet never quite smothered their warmth.</p>

                    <p>Everyone knew the fate of queer souls in horror: blood on the floor, a shriek cut short, a body discarded for the sake of tension.</p>

                    <p>If you were a woman who loved another woman, you were doomed—either sacrificed for shock value or erased altogether.</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>It was a rule, older than the monsters themselves. And since Alice and Rachel weren’t meant to survive their own story, their doom was inevitable.</p>

                    <p>When the masked killer drove them into the woods, the Reaper wove himself into the fog, emerging beside the villain in a hush of deathly air.</p>

                    <p>A skeletal hand pointed at the destruction. “Enough,” he said sharply. “You’ve taken the straight ones. Why must you take these as well?”</p>
