                    <p>Alice and Rachel were the perfect horror movie couple. Dark hair like the void, eyes shimmering with spectral light, their love a candle flickering in the night’s maw.</p>

                    <p>The audience held its breath at their slow-burn devotion—the stolen glances, the fragile touches, the way horror curled itself around them yet never quite smothered their warmth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>That should have been the first omen.</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>Everyone knew the fate of queer souls in horror: blood on the floor, a shriek cut short, a body discarded for the sake of tension.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>If you were a woman who loved another woman, you were doomed—either sacrificed for shock value or erased altogether.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>It was a rule, older than the monsters themselves. And since Alice and Rachel weren’t meant to survive their own story, their doom was inevitable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>The shadows had sharpened their knives, the script inked with cruel intent. But the Reaper—hooded and hollow-eyed—had grown weary of this rote execution.</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>How many times had he harvested love like theirs, severing hands meant to hold, silencing voices meant to endure?</p>

                <div class="story-section">

                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>When the masked killer drove them into the woods, the Reaper wove himself into the fog, emerging beside the villain in a hush of deathly air.</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>A skeletal hand gestured toward the carnage. “Enough,” he rasped, voice like autumn leaves crushed underfoot. “You have taken the straight ones. Must you take these, too?”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>The killer tilted his head, blade dripping. “The studio insists.”</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>The Reaper sighed, long and hollow, fingers tapping idly against the air. “Then next time, I choose.”</p>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <p>Rachel stumbled, her ankle catching on something in the dark. But this time, Alice’s grip tightened.</p>

                    <p>She pulled Rachel upright, and the script stuttered. The killer hesitated. The scene had fractured, diverging from its sinister design.</p>

                    <p>The audience, both in the flickering theater and the yawning abyss of horror’s long memory, gasped. This was not how it was supposed to end.</p>

                    <p>The film should have closed on their bodies, cold and lifeless. Instead, the credits rolled over two silhouettes, bruised yet breathing, vanishing into the mist-draped dawn.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the genre was due for an exorcism. Perhaps, at long last, the curse was broken.</p>
